# Dotfiles

My dotfiles! Some other config files as well.

## Setup

Setup occurs with `make`. It mostly creates symlinks from `$HOME` dir to files here.

```shell
make
```

Remember to add new files you want to use to Makefile `dotfiles` command.

Install dependencies from `Brewfile`:

```shell
make deps
```
